## Runtime Environment

This application supports the following browsers and operating system versions:

| Browser/OS | Version | Status |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---- |
| **Chrome** | 78 and above | âœ… |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 and above | âœ… |
| **macOS** | 10.15 and above | âœ… |
| **Linux** | 18.04 and above | âœ… |

### Notes

- **Chrome**: Recommended to use the latest version for the best experience.
- **Operating System**: Ensure your system version meets the requirements to avoid compatibility issues.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. Clone the code

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Modify configuration

   - `.env`

     > If you haven't modified the server's default port, you only need to change `VITE_BASE_HOST` to your server IP. For domain name and HTTPS access configuration, use the configuration items at the bottom and modify `VITE_BASE_DOMAIN` to your domain name.

     ```bash
     VITE_BASE_HOST=your-server-ip

     VITE_WS_URL=ws://$VITE_BASE_HOST:10001
     VITE_API_URL=http://$VITE_BASE_HOST:10002
     VITE_CHAT_URL=http://$VITE_BASE_HOST:10008

     # VITE_BASE_DOMAIN=your-server-domain

     # VITE_WS_URL=wss://$VITE_BASE_DOMAIN/msg_gateway
     # VITE_API_URL=https://$VITE_BASE_DOMAIN/api
     # VITE_CHAT_URL=https://$VITE_BASE_DOMAIN/chat
     ```

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the results. By default, the Electron application will also start.

5. Start development and testing! ðŸŽ‰

## Audio/Video Calls

Supports one-to-one audio/video calls, and requires [server-side] deployment and configuration first.

### Note

- For web-based audio/video calls, you can only debug locally (localhost) or use it after deploying to an HTTPS site, due to browser security policy restrictions.

## Build ðŸš€

> This project allows building Web applications and Electron applications separately, but there are some differences in the build process.

### Web Application

1. Run the following command to build the Web application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The build results will be in the `dist` directory.

### Electron Application

1. Replace the contents of `package.json` with `package_electron.json`, keeping only the dependencies required for Electron operation, which will significantly reduce package size. Also, modify the packaging script.

2. Run one of the following commands on the corresponding system to build the Electron application:

   > For cross-compilation, only macOS environment supports packaging installation packages for other systems. Windows or Linux only supports packaging installation packages for their respective systems.

   - macOS:
     ```bash
     npm run build:mac
     ```
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     npm run build:win
     ```
   - Linux:
     ```bash
     npm run build:linux
     ```

3. The build results will be in the `release` directory.
